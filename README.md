Designed an interface for a nutrition based mobile application using the User Centered Design methodology and procedures. The project included creation of low fidelity and mid-fidelity prototype for the NutriMe application we designed by constant inclusion of the user feedback. 

The project was a team work of Priyanka Goyal, Surbhi Sahdev, Varshini Jaggannath and Brendan Kelly.
